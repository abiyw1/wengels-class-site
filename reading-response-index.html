    <h1> Reading Assigment </h1>
<p>
The reading was very intresting in my opinion. I found the term handmade web intresting as well. Explining the diffrence between what a handmade website and a software based website was something that I did not know. I feel like handmade website gives the feel of an experiemntal art or film. By doing a handmade website all the creative control can allow for people to make a lot of really cool things that a softweare based website would not be able to do.
