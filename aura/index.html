    <h1> Aura Concept and Ideas </h1>
<p>
  I think for this website I want to focus on the color yellow and how it can make me feel. I love sunflowers and the sun and a beautiful yellow raincoat and I just love how that color can really brighten up a persons day. So I think I want yellow to be my big influence maybe like little frogs wearing yellow or something like that as my page. Im not quite sure what else I would want it to be about but these are some of the ideas I have. I want this website to feel happy and bright but not like obnoxious or odd in anyway. And I don't plan to just use yellow but also some other colors like greens and blues and reds to help accent and add to the yellow that is being brought up.
